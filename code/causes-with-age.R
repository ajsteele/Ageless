#' This graph shows how the incidence of and deaths caused by different
#' age-related diseases varies with age. Most of them follow an
#' exponential-ish distribution, remaining relatively flat for most of life and
#' increasing very rapidly in old age.
#' 
#' Alzheimer's has a particularly strong association with age. The WHO rates it
#' as having zero incidence up to and including the
#' `r alz_max_age_zero_incidence$age_group_name`
#' age group; its incidence in the 55 to 59 category is
#' `r pretty_number(alz_under_60$val, 2)` per 100,000; and between the ages of
#' 55 and 90 its incidence doubles every `r pretty_number(alz_dt, 3)` years.
#' 
#' This table shows how much more likely an 80-year-old is than a 30-year-old to
#' experience a certain cause of death or disability:

incidence_80_vs_30 %>%
  # Create pretty numbers to print
  mutate(
    `cause` = cause,
    `incidence ratio` = pretty_number(ratio, 3)
  ) %>%
  # Remove columns not to display
  select(-c('ratio')) %>%
  # Use kable to knit a nice table
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

#' Alzheimer's is infinite because the incidence at age 30 is zero. Diabetes
#' has around the same incidence because both 30 and 80 are in the tails of the
#' incidence distributionâ€”most people get diabetes in middle age if they're
#' going to.

death_80_vs_30 %>%
  # Create pretty numbers to print
  mutate(
    `cause` = cause,
    `death ratio` = pretty_number(ratio, 3)
  ) %>%
  # Remove columns not to display
  select(-c('ratio')) %>%
  # Use kable to knit a nice table
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

#' Alzheimer's is infinite because the death rate at age 30 is zero, and
#' neonatal problems is not a number because they obviously affect neither
#' 30- nor 80-year-olds.
